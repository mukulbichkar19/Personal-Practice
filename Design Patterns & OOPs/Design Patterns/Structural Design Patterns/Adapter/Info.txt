Adapter Design Pattern:-
1. Allows 2 incompatible interfaces to work together
2. Used when client expects a target interface.
3. The Adapter Class allows the use of available interface and the Target Interface.
4. Any class can work together as long as the Adapter solves the issue that all classes must implement every method defined in the shared interface.
