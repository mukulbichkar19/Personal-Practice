1. Used when you want to create a large number of Similar Objects.
2. To reduce memory usage you share Objects that are similar in some way rather than creating new ones.
3. Flyweight pattern is primarily used to reduce the number of objects created and to decrease memory footprint and increase performance.
4. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern provides ways to decrease object count thus improving the object structure of application.
5. The flyweight pattern is a structural design pattern.
6. In the flyweight pattern, instead of creating large numbers of similar objects, objects are reused. This can be used to reduce memory requirements and instantiation time and related costs.
