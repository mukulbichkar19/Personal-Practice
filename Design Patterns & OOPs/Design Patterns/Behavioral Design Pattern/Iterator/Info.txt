The iterator pattern is a behavioral object design pattern. The iterator pattern allows for the traversal through the elements in a grouping of objects via a standardized interface. An Iterator interface defines the actions that can be performed. These actions include being able to traverse the objects and also obtain the objects.

JavaSW features the widely used java.util.Iterator interface which is used to iterate through things such as Java collections. We can write our own iterator by implementing java.util.Iterator. This interface features the hasNext(), next(), and remove() methods. When writing an iterator for a class, it is very common for the iterator class to be an inner class of the class that we'd like to iterate through.
