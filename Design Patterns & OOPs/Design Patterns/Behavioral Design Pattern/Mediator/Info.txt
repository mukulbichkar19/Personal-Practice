The mediator pattern is a behavioral object design pattern. The mediator pattern centralizes communication between objects into a mediator object. This centralization is useful since it localizes in one place the interactions between objects, which can increase code maintainability, especially as the number of classes in an application increases. Since communication occurs with the mediator rather than directly with other objects, the mediator pattern results in a loose coupling of objects.

The classes that communicate with the mediator are known as Colleagues. The mediator implementation is known as the Concrete Mediator. The mediator can have an interface that spells out the communication with Colleagues. Colleagues know their mediator, and the mediator knows its colleagues.
