In the template method pattern, a method (the 'template method') defines the steps of an algorithm. The implementation of these steps (ie, methods) can be deferred to subclasses. Thus, a particular algorithm is defined in the template method, but the exact steps of this algorithm can be defined in subclasses. The template method is implemented in an abstract class. The steps (methods) of the algorithm are declared in the abstract class, and the methods whose implementations are to be delegated to subclasses are declared abstract.

Used to create a group of subclasses that have to execute similar group of methods.

You create an abstract class that contains a method called Template Method

The Template Method contains a series of method calls that every subclass object will call.

The subclass objects can override some of the method calls.
